ðŸ§© CS 320 â€“ Software Testing & Automation

Repository Description:
Portfolio artifacts demonstrating proficiency in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. This repository includes tested Java service classes and a reflection report that highlight my ability to create unit tests, validate requirements, and design maintainable, secure software systems.

ðŸ“¦ Submitted Artifacts

Project One: Contact.java, ContactService.java, ContactTest.java, ContactServiceTest.java

Project Two: Summary and Reflections Report

These artifacts showcase my experience with JUnit testing, test-driven development, and quality assurance practices that ensure software reliability and scalability.

ðŸ’¡ Reflection

Ensuring that my code and software are functional and secure begins with disciplined testing and secure design principles. In these projects, I used JUnit 5 to write detailed unit tests that verified functionality and helped detect issues early. Testing each component independently confirmed that the system behaved predictably, while validation logic within the code prevented invalid inputs and protected the data integrity of the Contact Service application. Writing secure and well-tested code minimizes risk and builds user confidence.

When interpreting user needs, I focus on understanding the purpose behind each requirement and translating it into clear, functional behavior. For example, in the Contact Service, users needed to manage contacts easily while enforcing constraints such as unique IDs and limited field lengths. By translating those needs into method logic and test assertions, I ensured the program worked as intended. This process reinforced the importance of aligning technical implementation with the userâ€™s real-world goals.

My software design approach emphasizes clarity, modularity, and maintainability. I start with small, focused classes that each serve a single purpose, allowing for simpler debugging and future updates. I also integrate testing into every stage of development, following a test-driven mindset to ensure quality from the beginning. These practices promote efficiency, reduce errors, and make collaboration easier. Together, design discipline and automated testing form the foundation of producing reliable software.
